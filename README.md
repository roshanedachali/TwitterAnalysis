# TwitterAnalysis
This study sought to understand three types of celebrity apologies and attempted to understand which method was most effective in: 
(a) increasing the number of mentions (and therefore relevancy) of celebrities and 
(b) increasing the average sentiment score of Tweets pertaining to celebrities. 

This study tracked the average number of mentions and sentiment score using Python's TextBlob package and total Twitter mentions per day over a three week timeline of 3 social media celebrities (Jenna Marbles, Logan Paul, and Charli D'Amelio) during their most public scandals in the past 5 years. The celebrities studied in this paper were chosen based on their stature and the types of scandals they were involved in. 

Findings indicated that not apologizing was the most effective method of crisis communication to increase the average number of mentions per day and the average sentiment score of users on Twitter as opposed to offering genuine or ingenuine apologies.
